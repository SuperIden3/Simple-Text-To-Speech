# Simple Text to Speech

A simple text-to-speech page with controls of voice, pitch, volume, and rate change thanks to JavaScript's **Speech API**.

Type in the text you want to read, the voice to speak in, the pitch for reading, volume for listening, and rate for speed.
Then, press the _Speak_ button to set configurations for the `SpeechSynthesisUtterance`, then speaks the text with the set configurations.
